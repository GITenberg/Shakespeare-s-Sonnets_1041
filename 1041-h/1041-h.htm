<h3>
  I<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  From fairest creatures we desire increase,<br />
  That thereby beauty's rose might never die,<br />
  But as the riper should by time decease,<br />
  His tender heir might bear his memory:<br />
  But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,<br />
  Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,<br />
  Making a famine where abundance lies,<br />
  Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:<br />
  Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,<br />
  And only herald to the gaudy spring,<br />
  Within thine own bud buriest thy content,<br />
  And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pity the world, or else this glutton be,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.<br />
</p>

<h3>
  II<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,<br />
  And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,<br />
  Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,<br />
  Will be a tatter'd weed of small worth held:<br />
  Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,<br />
  Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;<br />
  To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,<br />
  Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.<br />
  How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use,<br />
  If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine<br />
  Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,'<br />
  Proving his beauty by succession thine!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This were to be new made when thou art old,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.<br />
</p>

<h3>
  III<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest<br />
  Now is the time that face should form another;<br />
  Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,<br />
  Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.<br />
  For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb<br />
  Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?<br />
  Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,<br />
  Of his self-love to stop posterity?<br />
  Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee<br />
  Calls back the lovely April of her prime;<br />
  So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,<br />
  Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  But if thou live, remember'd not to be,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Die single and thine image dies with thee.<br />
</p>

<h3>
  IV<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend<br />
  Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?<br />
  Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,<br />
  And being frank she lends to those are free:<br />
  Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse<br />
  The bounteous largess given thee to give?<br />
  Profitless usurer, why dost thou use<br />
  So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?<br />
  For having traffic with thy self alone,<br />
  Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive:<br />
  Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,<br />
  What acceptable audit canst thou leave?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Which, used, lives th' executor to be.<br />
</p>

<h3>
  V<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Those hours, that with gentle work did frame<br />
  The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,<br />
  Will play the tyrants to the very same<br />
  And that unfair which fairly doth excel;<br />
  For never-resting time leads summer on<br />
  To hideous winter, and confounds him there;<br />
  Sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,<br />
  Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:<br />
  Then were not summer's distillation left,<br />
  A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,<br />
  Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,<br />
  Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  But flowers distill'd, though they with winter meet,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.<br />
</p>

<h3>
  VI<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,<br />
  In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:<br />
  Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place<br />
  With beauty's treasure ere it be self-kill'd.<br />
  That use is not forbidden usury,<br />
  Which happies those that pay the willing loan;<br />
  That's for thy self to breed another thee,<br />
  Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;<br />
  Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,<br />
  If ten of thine ten times refigur'd thee:<br />
  Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,<br />
  Leaving thee living in posterity?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.<br />
</p>

<h3>
  VII<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Lo! in the orient when the gracious light<br />
  Lifts up his burning head, each under eye<br />
  Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,<br />
  Serving with looks his sacred majesty;<br />
  And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,<br />
  Resembling strong youth in his middle age,<br />
  Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,<br />
  Attending on his golden pilgrimage:<br />
  But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,<br />
  Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,<br />
  The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are<br />
  From his low tract, and look another way:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Unlook'd, on diest unless thou get a son.<br />
</p>

<h3>
  VIII<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?<br />
  Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:<br />
  Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,<br />
  Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?<br />
  If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,<br />
  By unions married, do offend thine ear,<br />
  They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds<br />
  In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.<br />
  Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,<br />
  Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;<br />
  Resembling sire and child and happy mother,<br />
  Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sings this to thee: 'Thou single wilt prove none.'<br />
</p>

<h3>
  IX<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,<br />
  That thou consum'st thy self in single life?<br />
  Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die,<br />
  The world will wail thee like a makeless wife;<br />
  The world will be thy widow and still weep<br />
  That thou no form of thee hast left behind,<br />
  When every private widow well may keep<br />
  By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:<br />
  Look! what an unthrift in the world doth spend<br />
  Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;<br />
  But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,<br />
  And kept unused the user so destroys it.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  No love toward others in that bosom sits<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.<br />
</p>

<h3>
  X<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,<br />
  Who for thy self art so unprovident.<br />
  Grant, if thou wilt, thou art belov'd of many,<br />
  But that thou none lov'st is most evident:<br />
  For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate,<br />
  That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,<br />
  Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate<br />
  Which to repair should be thy chief desire.<br />
  O! change thy thought, that I may change my mind:<br />
  Shall hate be fairer lodg'd than gentle love?<br />
  Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,<br />
  Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Make thee another self for love of me,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  That beauty still may live in thine or thee.<br />
</p>

<h3>
  XI<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow'st,<br />
  In one of thine, from that which thou departest;<br />
  And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,<br />
  Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest,<br />
  Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase;<br />
  Without this folly, age, and cold decay:<br />
  If all were minded so, the times should cease<br />
  And threescore year would make the world away.<br />
  Let those whom nature hath not made for store,<br />
  Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:<br />
  Look, whom she best endow'd, she gave thee more;<br />
  Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  She carv'd thee for her seal, and meant thereby,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.<br />
</p>

<h3>
  XII<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  When I do count the clock that tells the time,<br />
  And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;<br />
  When I behold the violet past prime,<br />
  And sable curls, all silvered o'er with white;<br />
  When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,<br />
  Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,<br />
  And summer's green all girded up in sheaves,<br />
  Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,<br />
  Then of thy beauty do I question make,<br />
  That thou among the wastes of time must go,<br />
  Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake<br />
  And die as fast as they see others grow;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.<br />
</p>

<h3>
  XIII<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  O! that you were your self; but, love you are<br />
  No longer yours, than you your self here live:<br />
  Against this coming end you should prepare,<br />
  And your sweet semblance to some other give:<br />
  So should that beauty which you hold in lease<br />
  Find no determination; then you were<br />
  Yourself again, after yourself's decease,<br />
  When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.<br />
  Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,<br />
  Which husbandry in honour might uphold,<br />
  Against the stormy gusts of winter's day<br />
  And barren rage of death's eternal cold?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  You had a father: let your son say so.<br />
</p>

<h3>
  XIV<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck;<br />
  And yet methinks I have astronomy,<br />
  But not to tell of good or evil luck,<br />
  Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;<br />
  Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,<br />
  Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,<br />
  Or say with princes if it shall go well<br />
  By oft predict that I in heaven find:<br />
  But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,<br />
  And constant stars in them I read such art<br />
  As 'Truth and beauty shall together thrive,<br />
  If from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert';<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Or else of thee this I prognosticate:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  'Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.'<br />
</p>

<h3>
  XV<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  When I consider every thing that grows<br />
  Holds in perfection but a little moment,<br />
  That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows<br />
  Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;<br />
  When I perceive that men as plants increase,<br />
  Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky,<br />
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,<br />
  And wear their brave state out of memory;<br />
  Then the conceit of this inconstant stay<br />
  Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,<br />
  Where wasteful Time debateth with decay<br />
  To change your day of youth to sullied night,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And all in war with Time for love of you,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  As he takes from you, I engraft you new.<br />
</p>

<h3>
  XVI<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  But wherefore do not you a mightier way<br />
  Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?<br />
  And fortify your self in your decay<br />
  With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?<br />
  Now stand you on the top of happy hours,<br />
  And many maiden gardens, yet unset,<br />
  With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,<br />
  Much liker than your painted counterfeit:<br />
  So should the lines of life that life repair,<br />
  Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,<br />
  Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,<br />
  Can make you live your self in eyes of men.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.<br />
</p>

<h3>
  XVII<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Who will believe my verse in time to come,<br />
  If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?<br />
  Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb<br />
  Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts.<br />
  If I could write the beauty of your eyes,<br />
  And in fresh numbers number all your graces,<br />
  The age to come would say 'This poet lies;<br />
  Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'<br />
  So should my papers, yellow'd with their age,<br />
  Be scorn'd, like old men of less truth than tongue,<br />
  And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage<br />
  And stretched metre of an antique song:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  But were some child of yours alive that time,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  You should live twice,--in it, and in my rhyme.<br />
</p>

<h3>
  XVIII<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br />
  Thou art more lovely and more temperate:<br />
  Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br />
  And summer's lease hath all too short a date:<br />
  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br />
  And often is his gold complexion dimm'd,<br />
  And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br />
  By chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:<br />
  But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br />
  Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,<br />
  Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,<br />
  When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,<br />
  And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;<br />
  Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,<br />
  And burn the long-liv'd phoenix, in her blood;<br />
  Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,<br />
  And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,<br />
  To the wide world and all her fading sweets;<br />
  But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:<br />
  O! carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,<br />
  Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;<br />
  Him in thy course untainted do allow<br />
  For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Yet, do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  My love shall in my verse ever live young.<br />

<p class="poem">
  A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,<br />
  Hast thou, the master mistress of my passion;<br />
  A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted<br />
  With shifting change, as is false women's fashion:<br />
  An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,<br />
  Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;<br />
  A man in hue all 'hues' in his controlling,<br />
  Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.<br />
  And for a woman wert thou first created;<br />
  Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,<br />
  And by addition me of thee defeated,<br />
  By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.<br />

<p class="poem">
  So is it not with me as with that Muse,<br />
  Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,<br />
  Who heaven itself for ornament doth use<br />
  And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,<br />
  Making a couplement of proud compare.<br />
  With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,<br />
  With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare,<br />
  That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.<br />
  O! let me, true in love, but truly write,<br />
  And then believe me, my love is as fair<br />
  As any mother's child, though not so bright<br />
  As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Let them say more that like of hearsay well;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I will not praise that purpose not to sell.<br />

<p class="poem">
  My glass shall not persuade me I am old,<br />
  So long as youth and thou are of one date;<br />
  But when in thee time's furrows I behold,<br />
  Then look I death my days should expiate.<br />
  For all that beauty that doth cover thee,<br />
  Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,<br />
  Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:<br />
  How can I then be elder than thou art?<br />
  O! therefore love, be of thyself so wary<br />
  As I, not for myself, but for thee will;<br />
  Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary<br />
  As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.<br />

<p class="poem">
  As an unperfect actor on the stage,<br />
  Who with his fear is put beside his part,<br />
  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,<br />
  Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;<br />
  So I, for fear of trust, forget to say<br />
  The perfect ceremony of love's rite,<br />
  And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,<br />
  O'ercharg'd with burthen of mine own love's might.<br />
  O! let my looks be then the eloquence<br />
  And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,<br />
  Who plead for love, and look for recompense,<br />
  More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  O! learn to read what silent love hath writ:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.<br />

  For through the painter must you see his skill,<br />
  To find where your true image pictur'd lies,<br />
  Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,<br />
  That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.<br />
  Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:<br />
  Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me<br />
  Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun<br />
  Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  They draw but what they see, know not the heart.<br />

  Let me not to the marriage of true minds<br />
  Admit impediments. Love is not love<br />
  Which alters when it alteration finds,<br />
  Or bends with the remover to remove:<br />
  O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark,<br />
  That looks on tempests and is never shaken;<br />
  It is the star to every wandering bark,<br />
  Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.<br />
  Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks<br />
  Within his bending sickle's compass come;<br />
  Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,<br />
  But bears it out even to the edge of doom.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  If this be error and upon me prov'd,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.<br />

  Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,<br />
  Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?<br />
  Why so large cost, having so short a lease,<br />
  Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?<br />
  Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,<br />
  Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body's end?<br />
  Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,<br />
  And let that pine to aggravate thy store;<br />
  Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;<br />
  Within be fed, without be rich no more:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  So shall thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And Death once dead, there's no more dying then.<br />

(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
